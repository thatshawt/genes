thinking of doing NEAT but replace the network graph with a program graph.
combine the NEAT with programs with a curriculum.

the hard part is making a high quality curriculum to accomplish the tasks that you want.
im guessing that the curriculum will have to be pretty long to evolve anything useful.
^^^^^^^
ill think of optimizations as i go.

TODO: (in order)
*   design a general NEAT algorithm for graphs.
        ()
*
design a program interpreter (im thinking making it procedural).

then the NEAT algorithm for it.
